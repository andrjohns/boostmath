\description{
Functions to compute Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind, and
efficiently evaluate Chebyshev series using Clenshaw's recurrence algorithm.

Chebyshev polynomials are orthogonal polynomials used extensively in approximation
theory, numerical analysis, and spectral methods. They minimize the Runge phenomenon
in polynomial interpolation.

\strong{Chebyshev Polynomials of the First Kind T_n(x):}
\itemize{
\item \code{chebyshev_t(n, x)}: Evaluates \eqn{T_n(x)}
\item Recurrence relation: \eqn{T_{n+1}(x) = 2xT_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x)} for n > 0
\item Initial conditions: T_0(x) = 1, T_1(x) = x
\item \code{chebyshev_t_prime(n, x)}: Derivative of T_n(x)
\item Stable evaluation for x  in  \eqn{[-1, 1]} (mixed forward-backward stable)
}

\strong{Chebyshev Polynomials of the Second Kind U_n(x):}
\itemize{
\item \code{chebyshev_u(n, x)}: Evaluates U_n(x)
\item Related to T_n by differentiation
}

\strong{Recurrence Relation:}
\itemize{
\item \code{chebyshev_next(x, Tn, Tn_1)}: Computes \eqn{T_{n+1}(x)} from T_n and \eqn{T_{n-1}}
}

\strong{Clenshaw's Recurrence Algorithm:}

Efficient O(n) evaluation of Chebyshev series (alternative to O(n^2) direct computation):
\itemize{
\item \code{chebyshev_clenshaw_recurrence(c, x)}: Evaluates Chebyshev series with
coefficients c at point x on standard interval \eqn{[-1, 1]}
\item \code{chebyshev_clenshaw_recurrence_ab(c, a, b, x)}: Evaluates Chebyshev series
on arbitrary interval \eqn{[a, b]} using Reinsch's modification
}

\strong{Stability:}

Evaluation by three-term recurrence is known to be mixed forward-backward stable
for x  in  \eqn{[-1, 1]}. Stability outside this interval is not established.
