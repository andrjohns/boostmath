\description{
Functions to compute the sinus cardinal (sinc) and hyperbolic sinus cardinal (sinhc) functions.

These functions appear in signal processing, Fourier analysis, and various mathematical
applications. The implementations avoid numerical instability near x = 0.

\strong{Sinus Cardinal Function:}

The sinc function is defined as:
\deqn{sinc(\pi x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x}}
\itemize{
\item \code{sinc_pi(x)}: Computes sinc(pix) = sin(pix)/(pix)
\item Special value: sinc_pi(0) = 1 (by L'Hopital's rule or Taylor series)
\item The function oscillates with decreasing amplitude as |x| increases
\item Used extensively in signal processing (ideal low-pass filter impulse response)
\item Appears in the Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula
}

\strong{Hyperbolic Sinus Cardinal Function:}

The hyperbolic sinc function is defined as:
\deqn{sinhc(\pi x) = \frac{\sinh(\pi x)}{\pi x}}
\itemize{
\item \code{sinhc_pi(x)}: Computes sinhc(pix) = sinh(pix)/(pix)
\item Special value: sinhc_pi(0) = 1 (by L'Hopital's rule or Taylor series)
\item The function grows exponentially for large |x|
\item Analogous to sinc but using hyperbolic sine instead of circular sine
}

\strong{Numerical Stability:}

Both functions use Taylor series expansions near x = 0 to avoid division by zero
and loss of precision. For x away from 0, direct evaluation is used.
