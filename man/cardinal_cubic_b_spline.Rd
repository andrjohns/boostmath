\value{
An object of class \code{cardinal_cubic_b_spline} with methods:
\itemize{
\item \code{interpolate(x)}: Evaluate the spline at point \code{x}.

\description{
The cardinal cubic B-spline interpolator allows for fast and accurate interpolation of a function
which is known at equally spaced points.

\strong{Mathematical Properties:}

It uses compactly supported basis functions constructed via iterative convolution, ensuring numerical stability.
The interpolant is O(h^4) accurate for values and O(h^3) accurate for derivatives,
where h is the step size.

\strong{Conditions:}

Ideally, the function being interpolated should be four-times continuously differentiable.
If the derivatives at the endpoints are not provided, they are estimated using one-sided
finite-difference formulas.
