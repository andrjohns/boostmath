\description{
Functions to compute the Lambert W function and its derivatives for the principal branch
(W₀) and the branch -1 (W₋₁).

The Lambert W function (also known as the Omega function or product logarithm) is the
inverse of f(W) = W·e^W. It solves the equation:

\deqn{W(z) \cdot e^{W(z)} = z}

\strong{Branches:}

The function has two real branches:
\itemize{
\item \strong{W₀ (Principal Branch):}
\itemize{
\item Domain: [-1/e, ∞) where 1/e ≅ 0.367879
\item \code{lambert_w0(z)}: Returns the principal branch value
\item \code{lambert_w0_prime(z)}: Returns the derivative of W₀
\item For z ≥ 0, there is a single real solution
}
\item \strong{W₋₁ (Secondary Branch):}
\itemize{
\item Domain: [-1/e, 0)
\item \code{lambert_wm1(z)}: Returns the -1 branch value
\item \code{lambert_wm1_prime(z)}: Returns the derivative of W₋₁
\item Exists where two real solutions occur on (-1/e, 0)
\item As z approaches 0, W₋₁(z) approaches -∞
}
}

\strong{Special Values:}
\itemize{
\item W₀(-1/e) = -1 (exactly)
\item W₋₁(-1/e) = -1 (exactly)
\item W₋₁(0) = -∞
}

\strong{Singularity:}

At z = -1/e ≅ -0.367879, the two branches meet and the condition number of
function evaluation tends to infinity.

The implementation uses Halley's method and Newton-Raphson iteration for
numerical refinement. Applications include solving transcendental equations,
delay differential equations, and enumeration problems.
