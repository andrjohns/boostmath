\usage{
hermite(n, x)

hermite_next(n, x, Hn, Hnm1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Degree of the polynomial (practical limit ~120)}

\item{x}{Argument of the polynomial}

\item{Hn}{Value of the Hermite polynomial H_n(x)}

\item{Hnm1}{Value of the Hermite polynomial \deqn{H_{n-1}(x)}}
}
\value{
A single numeric value with the computed Hermite polynomial.
}
\description{
Functions to compute Hermite polynomials using three-term recurrence relations.

Hermite polynomials are orthogonal polynomials that appear in probability theory
(as derivatives of the Gaussian function), quantum mechanics (quantum harmonic
oscillator), and numerical analysis.

\strong{Hermite Polynomials H_n(x):}
\itemize{
\item \code{hermite(n, x)}: Evaluates the Hermite polynomial of degree n at point x
\item Orthogonal with respect to the weight function \deqn{e^{-x²}} on (-∞, ∞)
\item Appear as eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator
}

\strong{Recurrence Relation:}
\itemize{
\item \code{hermite_next(n, x, Hn, Hnm1)}: Computes \deqn{H_{n+1}(x)} from H_n and \deqn{H_{n-1}}
\item Uses stable three-term recurrence for sequential computation
}

\strong{Implementation Notes:}
\itemize{
\item Guarantees low absolute error but not low relative error near polynomial roots
\item Values greater than ~120 for n are unlikely to produce sensible results
\item Relative errors may grow arbitrarily large when the function is very close to a root

# Hermite polynomial H_2(0.5)
hermite(2, 0.5)
# Next Hermite polynomial H_3(0.5) using H_2(0.5) and H_1(0.5)
