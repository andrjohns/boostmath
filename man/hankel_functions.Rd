\description{
Functions to compute cylindrical and spherical Hankel functions of the first and second kinds.

Hankel functions are complex-valued combinations of Bessel functions that are particularly
useful in solving wave equations and problems involving cylindrical or spherical symmetry.

\strong{Cylindrical Hankel Functions:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{First Kind:}
\deqn{H_v^{(1)}(x) = J_v(x) + i Y_v(x)}
where J_v is the Bessel function of the first kind and Y_v is the Bessel function
of the second kind.
\item \strong{Second Kind:}
\deqn{H_v^{(2)}(x) = J_v(x) - i Y_v(x)}
}

These functions return complex-valued results. Computing a single Hankel function call
is more efficient than making separate calls to the Bessel J and Y functions, since both
components are calculated simultaneously.

\strong{Spherical Hankel Functions:}

Spherical variants h_v^(1) and h_v^(2) are implemented in terms of the cylindrical
Hankel functions and are used in problems with spherical symmetry, such as
electromagnetic wave propagation.

All functions operate across the entire range of v and x values and return complex numbers.
