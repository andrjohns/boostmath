\title{Runs Tests}
\usage{
runs_above_and_below_threshold(v, threshold)

runs_above_and_below_median(v)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{A numeric vector containing the sequence to test.}

\item{threshold}{A single numeric value to serve as the threshold for the test (for \code{runs_above_and_below_threshold}).}
}
\value{
A two-element numeric vector:
\itemize{
\item The first element is the \strong{t-statistic}.
\item The second element is the \strong{p-value} (two-sided).
}
}
\description{
The runs test is a statistical test that checks a randomness hypothesis for a two-valued data sequence.
It can be used to test the hypothesis that the elements of the sequence are mutually independent.

\strong{Runs Above and Below Median:}
Determines if a sequence is random by observing the number of consecutive values which exceed (or are below) the median of the sequence.
Values equal to the median are ignored.
The expected number of runs and variance are calculated according to NIST standards to derive a test statistic and p-value.
This function calculates the median internally.

\strong{Runs Above and Below Threshold:}
similar to the median test, but uses a user-specified \code{threshold} instead of the calculated median.
This is more efficient if the median is already known or if a different threshold is required.
}
\details{
The test statistic is approximated as a standard normal distribution to extract the p-value.
If the p-value is small (e.g., < 0.05), the null hypothesis of randomness is rejected.

\examples{
# Runs Above and Below Threshold with a known threshold
v <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
runs_above_and_below_threshold(v, threshold = 3)

# Runs Above and Below Median (calculates median = 3 internally)
runs_above_and_below_median(v)

# Example of a non-random sequence (fewer runs than expected)
v_non_random <- c(rep(1, 5), rep(10, 5))
runs_above_and_below_median(v_non_random)
