\description{
Functions to compute the probability mass function (pmf), cumulative distribution
function, and quantile function for the Hypergeometric distribution.

For a population of size $N$ with $r$ successes and $N-r$ failures, drawing $n$
items without replacement, the probability of observing $k$ successes is

\deqn{P(X = k) = \frac{\binom{r}{k}\binom{N-r}{n-k}}{\binom{N}{n}}}

with support \eqn{k \in [\max(0, n + r - N), \min(n, r)]}.

\strong{Accuracy and Implementation Notes:}
For small $N$, factorial table lookup provides high accuracy. For larger $N$ up to
the largest stored prime, a prime-factorization method is used. For very large $N$,
accuracy degrades roughly by \deqn{\log_{10}(N)} digits. The CDF is computed by summing PDFs
using recurrence relations, and quantiles are obtained by summing from the tail.
As a strictly discrete distribution, quantiles are rounded outward to ensure coverage.
