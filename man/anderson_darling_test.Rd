\title{Anderson-Darling Test for Normality}
\usage{
anderson_darling_normality_statistic(x, mu = 0, sd = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of sample data (must be sorted in ascending order).}

\item{mu}{The mean of the normal distribution to test against. Default is 0.}

\item{sd}{The standard deviation of the normal distribution to test against. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
The Anderson-Darling A² test statistic.
}
\description{
Performs the Anderson-Darling test for normality by computing the A² test statistic.

The Anderson-Darling test evaluates whether a sample comes from a normal distribution
by computing an integral over the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF)
and comparing it against the normal distribution's CDF.

\strong{Interpretation:}
\itemize{
\item When A²/n approaches zero as sample size increases, the normality hypothesis is supported
\item When A²/n converges to a positive finite value, the normality hypothesis lacks support
}

\strong{Important:} The input data vector \code{x} must be sorted in ascending order. Unsorted
data will trigger an error.

\strong{Parameter Modes:}
\itemize{
\item If \code{mu} and \code{sd} are provided, the test compares against N(mu, sd²)
\item If \code{mu} and \code{sd} are not provided (default), they are estimated from the data
}
