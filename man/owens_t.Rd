\title{Owens T Function}
\usage{
owens_t(h, a)
}
\arguments{
\item{h}{The first argument of the Owens T function (boundary parameter)}

\item{a}{The second argument of the Owens T function (slope parameter)}
}
\value{
The value of the Owens T function at (h, a).
}
\description{
Computes Owen's T function T(h, a), which gives the probability of the event
(X > h and 0 < Y < a*X) where X and Y are independent standard normal random variables.

\strong{Geometric Interpretation:}

For positive h and a, T(h, a) represents the volume of an uncorrelated bivariate
normal distribution with zero means and unit variances over the region bounded by
y = ax, y = 0, and x = h.

\strong{Special Cases:}
\itemize{
\item T(h, 0) = 0
\item T(0, a) = (1/2pi) arctan(a)
\item T(h, 1) = (1/2) Phi(h) [1 - Phi(h)], where Phi is the standard normal CDF
\item T(h, Inf) = Phi(|h|)
}

\strong{Applications:}

Owen's T function is essential for computing the skew normal distribution and
probabilities for bivariate and multivariate normal distributions. It appears in
statistical inference, power calculations, and various probability computations
involving correlated normal variables.
