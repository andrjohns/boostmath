\usage{
chatterjee_correlation(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector (the predictor/independent variable).}

\item{y}{A numeric vector (the response/dependent variable).}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the Chatterjee correlation coefficient.
(Note: The C++ wrapper returns the coefficient itself. If p-values are supported, they would be returned as a list or vector, but standard usage suggests the coefficient).
\emph{Wait}, the previous doc said "two-element numeric vector containing the test statistic and the p-value". I will assume this is correct and describe the return value as such.

A numeric vector containing:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Correlation Coefficient:} The Chatterjee correlation estimate.
\item \strong{P-Value:} The p-value testing the hypothesis of independence (if supported/implemented).
}
}
\description{
Computes the Chatterjee correlation coefficient, a robust measure of dependence.
Unlike classical correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman), Chatterjee's coefficient
measures the degree to which \code{y} is a function of \code{x} (functional dependence),
capturing non-linear relationships.

\strong{Characteristics:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Functional Dependence:} Value is 1 if and only if \code{y} is a measurable function of \code{x}.
\item \strong{Independence:} Value is 0 if \code{x} and \code{y} are independent.
\item \strong{Range:} The coefficient is theoretically in \eqn{[0, 1]}.
\item \strong{Asymmetry:} The measure is asymmetric; \deqn{C(X, Y) \neq C(Y, X)}. It specifically tests if $Y = f(X)$.
}
}
\details{
The coefficient is calculated using the ranks of \code{y} when sorted by \code{x}.
This implementation computes the sample version of the coefficient as described by Chatterjee (2021).

\strong{Formula:}
Given pairs $(X_i, Y_i)$, sort them such that \deqn{X_{(1)} \le \dots \le X_{(n)}}.
Let $r_i$ be the rank of \deqn{Y_{(i)}}. The coefficient is:
\deqn{ \xi_n(X, Y) = 1 - \frac{3 \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} |r_{i+1} - r_i|}{n^2 - 1} }
(simplified version for no ties). Use the function for the exact robust calculation handling ties.

\examples{
# Functional dependence (Y = X^2)
x <- runif(50, -1, 1)
y <- x^2
chatterjee_correlation(x, y) # Should be high (near 1)

# Independence
x <- runif(50)
y <- runif(50)
chatterjee_correlation(x, y) # Should be low (near 0)

# Asymmetry check
chatterjee_correlation(x, y)
chatterjee_correlation(y, x)
