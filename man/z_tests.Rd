\usage{
one_sample_z_test_params(
  sample_mean,
  sample_variance,
  num_samples,
  assumed_mean
)

one_sample_z_test(u, assumed_mean)

two_sample_z_test(u, v)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_mean}{Numeric. The mean of the sample.}

\item{sample_variance}{Numeric. The variance of the sample.}

\item{num_samples}{Integer. The size of the sample.}

\item{assumed_mean}{Numeric. The null hypothesis mean value to test against.}

\item{u}{A numeric vector containing the first sample.}

\item{v}{A numeric vector containing the second sample (for two-sample test).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Statistic:} The computed Z-statistic.
\item \strong{P-Value:} The two-sided p-value associated with the Z-statistic.
}
}
\description{
Statistical hypothesis tests for population means using the Normal (Z) distribution.

Z-tests are typically used when:
\enumerate{
\item The population variance is known.
\item The sample size is large (N > 30), allowing the sample variance to approximate the population variance (via Central Limit Theorem).
}

\strong{One-Sample Tests:}
\itemize{
\item \code{one_sample_z_test}: Performs a Z-test on a data vector \code{u} against an \code{assumed_mean}.
\item \code{one_sample_z_test_params}: Performs a Z-test given summary statistics (mean, variance, N).
}

\strong{Two-Sample Tests:}
\itemize{
\item \code{two_sample_z_test}: Performs a Z-test comparing the means of two data vectors \code{u} and \code{v}.
}
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Statistic:} The Z-statistic is calculated as \deqn{Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}}.
\item \strong{Assumptions:} The underlying distribution is Normal, or the sample size is large enough for the CLT to apply.

\examples{
# --- One-Sample Z-Test ---
data1 <- c(5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 8)
# Test if population mean is 4
one_sample_z_test(data1, assumed_mean = 4)

# Using Summary Statistics
# Mean = 2, Variance = 1, N = 30, Null Mean = 0
one_sample_z_test_params(sample_mean = 2,
                         sample_variance = 1,
                         num_samples = 30,
                         assumed_mean = 0)

# --- Two-Sample Z-Test ---
data2 <- c(4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 7)
# Test if data1 and data2 have different means
two_sample_z_test(data1, data2)
