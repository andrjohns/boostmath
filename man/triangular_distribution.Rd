\usage{
triangular_distribution(lower = -1, mode = 0, upper = 1)

triangular_pdf(x, lower = -1, mode = 0, upper = 1)

triangular_lpdf(x, lower = -1, mode = 0, upper = 1)

}
\arguments{
\item{lower}{lower limit of the distribution (default is -1)}

\item{mode}{mode of the distribution (default is 0)}

\item{upper}{upper limit of the distribution (default is 1)}

\item{x}{quantile}

\item{p}{probability (0 <= p <= 1)}
}
\value{
A single numeric value with the computed probability density, log-probability density, cumulative distribution, log-cumulative distribution, or quantile depending on the function called.
}
\description{
Functions to compute the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, and quantile function for the Triangular distribution.

The triangular distribution is a continuous probability distribution with a lower limit \eqn{a}, mode \eqn{c}, and upper limit \eqn{b}.
It is often used where the distribution is only vaguely known, but upper and lower limits are known, and a "best guess" (mode) is added.

It has the probability density function (PDF):
\deqn{f(x) = \frac{2(x-a)}{(b-a)(c-a)} \quad \text{for } a \le x \le c}
\deqn{f(x) = \frac{2(b-x)}{(b-a)(b-c)} \quad \text{for } c < x \le b}

\strong{Accuracy and Implementation Notes:}
The triangular distribution is implemented with simple arithmetic operators and so should have errors within an epsilon or two.
